## Redesign Strategy 

::: {.card .flow title = "Redesign Strategy"}
 
Redesigning high school by centering student agency through community-based research projects that challenge traditional structures and engage youth in civic inquiry. Our strategy integrates Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) into the AP Seminar and AP Research sequence, empowering students to investigate and challenge issues directly affecting their communities.

## Redesign Strategy 

::: {.card .flow title = "Redesign Strategy"}
 
Redesigning traditional assessment by centering the development of students’ empirical reasoning through community-based internships. The San Diego Science Project at UC San Diego has partnered with San Diego Met's Big Picture Learning community school to document, refine, and develop a replicable model for community schools wanting to implement authentic, community-centered assessment practices.
