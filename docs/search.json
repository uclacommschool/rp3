    "text": "Purpose\nThe purpose of the Research-Practice-Policy Partnership (RP3) Consortium is to connect innovative community redesign efforts with research and policy partners.\nThe consortium consists of 4 hubs that are each composed of a university and school partnership. These hubs are:\n\nUCLA & UCLA Community Schools\nLoyola Marymount University & Para Los Ni√±os\nUCSD & Big Picture Learning\nUCSD, San Diego State University, San Diego Unified School District, San Diego Education Association\n\n\n\n\nHub Locations\n\n\nEach hub, rooted in the work of UACS, will workshop and document a high-leverage redesign strategy to learn about its implementation challenges in schooling.\nThe work of the redesign hubs may include creating graduation portfolios tied to core competencies, centering community-based learning through capstone performance assessments, developing strong advisory programs to anchor socio-emotional learning, establishing infrastructure for youth participatory action research and civic engagement, learning through internships, and many other promising strategies.\nImportantly, each hub will develop evidence and measures of equity-centered thriving, both for individuals (e.g., well-being, college and career readiness) and communities (e.g., collective improvement capacity, democratic school culture).\nMoreover, these hubs will be strategically tied to organizations and networks working to create systems and policies that advance equity-centered thriving, for example, the State Performance Assessment Learning Community, CASEL, the College Board, the National Association of College Admissions Counseling, and others.\nThe UCLA Center for Community Schooling will provide the RP3 infrastructure to frame and help communicate the learning generated in these hubs, building on its state and national work to advance university-assisted community schools and community-based learning through convenings, open-access resources, and community school study tours.\n\n\n\nOverview of each hub.",
